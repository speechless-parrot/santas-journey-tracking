            <span class="material-symbols-rounded">schedule</span>
            When does the Santa Tracker start?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            The tracker officially goes live every <span class="highlight">December 24th</span>! Santa begins his final preparations at <span class="highlight">8:30 AM UTC</span>, which is when we start pre-tracking—you'll see little hints of Santa getting ready in the North Pole, reindeer stretching, and elves bustling around. He officially takes off <span class="highlight">1 hour and 30 minutes later</span>, kicking off his magical journey around the world. Santa completes his route and returns home to the North Pole at <span class="highlight">11:00 AM UTC</span>.
            <ul>
                <li>🇺🇸 New York, USA: 3:30 AM EST (pre-tracking begins)</li>
                <li>🇬🇧 London, UK: 8:30 AM GMT</li>
                <li>🇦🇺 Sydney, Australia: 7:30 PM AEDT</li>

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">
            <span class="material-symbols-rounded">home</span>
            When will Santa arrive at my home?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Santa usually delivers gifts <span class="highlight">close to midnight local time</span> to make sure all the presents arrive just in time for Christmas morning magic. The tracker provides an <span class="highlight">estimated arrival time</span> based on your location, so you can see when he's nearby. If you don't see your local ETA, check that your location permissions are enabled in your browser. This helps the tracker calculate the closest stop to your home for a more accurate estimate. Remember, Santa's journey is magical and fast, so the tracker gives you a really good idea, but he might appear slightly earlier or later depending on weather, reindeer speed, and other North Pole factors!

    <div class="faq-item">
        <div class="faq-question">
            <span class="material-symbols-rounded">public</span>
            What is the first and last place Santa visits?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Santa kicks off his journey with his first stop in <span class="highlight">Provideniya, Russia</span>, shortly after takeoff. From there, he zooms across the globe, hitting millions of homes in dozens of countries. His <span class="highlight">final delivery stop</span> is the <span class="highlight">islands of Hawaii</span>, about 25 hours later, before returning to the North Pole. This route ensures that kids everywhere experience the magic of Christmas in order of time zones. The tracker lets you follow along in real-time and watch Santa's progress across continents—it's literally like flying with him!

        <div class="faq-question">
            <span class="material-symbols-rounded">satellite_alt</span>
            How do you track Santa?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            We use a combination of <span class="highlight">real-time satellite imagery</span> and advanced magical North Pole tech to pinpoint Santa's location with incredible accuracy. Think of it like mixing top-secret elf radar with a sprinkle of festive magic—Santa's sleigh and reindeer movements are calculated in real-time, so you can watch him zoom across the globe with precision. The tracker automatically updates every second, so there's no refreshing needed—you'll always know exactly where he is on his journey!

        <div class="faq-question">
            <span class="material-symbols-rounded">track_changes</span>
            How is this tracker different from Google's and NORAD's?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Each tracker has its own unique style:
            <ul>
                <li><span class="highlight">NORAD Tracks Santa</span> comes from a real military command center, giving it a rich history and official tracking background.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Google's Santa Tracker</span> is known for its colorful games, videos, and fun interactive content.</li>
                <li><span class="highlight">Our Santa Tracker</span> focuses on a cozy, interactive North Pole village experience, with original games, North Pole news, and a fan-made festive journey for people who love Christmas.</li>
            </ul>
            Because of differences in tracking methods, each tracker may show Santa in slightly different locations. We pride ourselves on accuracy, but the slight differences just show the magic of Santa's speed and how creative tracking can be! We are <span class="highlight">not affiliated</span> with NORAD, the US military, or Google—we just share their love for spreading holiday cheer.

        <div class="faq-question">
            <span class="material-symbols-rounded">location_city</span>
            Why did Santa skip my city?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Santa's route is carefully planned, but it's impossible to visit <span class="highlight">every single city on Earth</span>. Some larger cities are skipped if nearby areas are already being covered, while smaller or more remote towns are included to ensure the Christmas spirit reaches everyone. Even if Santa doesn't land directly in your city, he still passes by and delivers gifts to homes nearby! Think of it as Santa prioritizing the smoothest and fastest route for all the reindeer to get home safely.

        <div class="faq-question">
            <span class="material-symbols-rounded">fullscreen</span>
            Can I make the tracker fullscreen?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Absolutely! There's a <span class="highlight">built-in fullscreen button</span> in the tracker for the cleanest experience. Click it once to expand the tracker, and again to exit fullscreen mode. You can also use your browser's native fullscreen option (F11 on most browsers), but sometimes tabs or other browser elements can still appear, so we recommend using the built-in tracker button. This way, you can see Santa zooming across the globe without distractions, like you're on the sleigh with him!

            How accurate is the ETA?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            The ETA is based on the <span class="highlight">closest Santa stop to your location</span>, so it's really reliable. While Santa is magical and super fast, the tracker gives a <span class="highlight">practical estimate</span> of when he'll pass by your area. This allows you to plan your cookie setup, stocking placements, and last-minute festive surprises. It's almost like having your own personal North Pole assistant guiding you through the night!

            What happens after tracking is complete?
        </div>
        <div class="faq-answer">
            Once Santa finishes his deliveries, the tracker closes for the year. But don't worry! You can <span class="highlight">still access the games and activities</span> for the rest of December. When the new year begins, day-specific activities will lock again until next December, and the homepage countdown will reset so we can <span class="highlight">prepare for next year's magical journey</span>. Essentially, the tracker transforms back into a cozy holiday hub until Santa's next flight!

            Nope! Santa doesn't start his journey until Dec 24th.

            Yes… in the most magical and joyful sense! Santa Claus is the embodiment of the Christmas spirit: generosity, kindness, and joy.

        <div class="faq-answer">
            Santa's home base is the <span class="highlight">North Pole</span>, a snowy, cozy village bustling with elves, reindeer, and festive magic. Think of it as a combination of a workshop, a research lab for toy innovation, and a winter wonderland.

Visitors are rare, but elves ensure everything runs smoothly year-round ❄️🛷✨.
