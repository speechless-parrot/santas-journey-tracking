        <p>THIS IS IT. THIS IS NOT A DRILL. ❄️😱🛷<br>
        Reporting live from a North Pole that has officially crossed into <strong>PURE FESTIVE MAYHEM</strong>, this is <strong>Jinglewick Frostline</strong>, and I am typing so fast my mittens are smoking 🔥🧤</p>

        <p>⏰ <strong>TWO. DAYS. UNTIL SANTA TAKES OFF.</strong><br>
        Forty-eight hours. Two sleeps. One final deep breath before the sleigh launches into legend. 🌍✨</p>

        <p>First — the BIGGEST SURPRISE to explode out of the workshop today 💥👇</p>

        <p>🎮🦌🧝 <strong>BRAND NEW GAME: REINDEER vs ELVES</strong> 🧝🦌🎮<br>
        Yes. It’s real.<br>
        Yes. It’s chaotic.<br>
        Yes. It’s GLOBAL. 🌍⚔️</p>

        <p>Try it here 👉 
            <a href="https://speechless-parrot.github.io/santas-journey-tracking/games/reindeer-vs-elves" target="_blank">
                https://speechless-parrot.github.io/santas-journey-tracking/games/reindeer-vs-elves
            </a>
        </p>

        <p>Here’s how it works:</p>
        <p>
            You spam-click to give points to <strong>either team</strong> — Reindeer 🦌 or Elves 🧝<br>
            You are NOT locked to one side (betrayal is allowed 😌)<br>
            Every click counts toward a <strong>worldwide total</strong><br>
            It’s a live, online battle of festive fury 💥🎄
        </p>

        <p>🧙‍♂️ <strong>The Lore (because of COURSE there’s lore):</strong><br>
        It all started during a snack break.<br>
        An elf claimed reindeer “just fly and nap.”<br>
        A reindeer replied that elves “just press buttons and scream.”<br>
        Someone brought up cookie rations.<br>
        Someone else mentioned carrot budgets.<br>
        Ten minutes later, the argument escalated into a full-scale North Pole rivalry, bells were ringing, hooves were stomping, and Santa shouted “MAKE IT A GAME AND SETTLE IT PEACEFULLY.” 🎅😤</p>

        <p>And thus… <strong>Reindeer vs Elves</strong> was born.<br>
        Now the whole world decides who reigns supreme. 👀🌍✨</p>

        <p>🛷 <strong>TEST FLIGHT UPDATE:</strong><br>
        Earlier TODAY, we conducted the <strong>second-last test flight</strong> of the season 😤🔥<br>
        Yes, the elves were woken up again.<br>
        Yes, morale survived (barely).<br>
        The sleigh handled speed boosts flawlessly, reindeer formation was near-perfect, and Rudolph’s nose brightness reached “visible from orbit” levels 🔴☀️<br>
        One final test flight is scheduled for <strong>December 23rd</strong> — the LAST rehearsal before the real thing.</p>

        <p>🎄 <strong>AROUND THE NORTH POLE RIGHT NOW:</strong></p>
        <p>
            • The workshop is officially running 24/7 ⏱️🎁<br>
            • Santa has triple-checked the list 📜✔️✔️✔️<br>
            • The cocoa machines are overheating ☕🔥<br>
            • The bells are tuned 🔔✨<br>
            • The countdown clocks are glowing ominously ⏰❄️<br>
            • Elves are either excited, panicking, or both simultaneously 🧝‍♂️😵‍💫
        </p>

        <p>This will <strong>very likely be the final update</strong> before tracking begins.<br>
        Next time you hear from us… Santa may already be in the air. 🌍🛷💫</p>

        <p>
            So play the games 🎮<br>
            Send your last messages 💌<br>
            Get your pajamas ready 😴<br>
            And remember…
        </p>

            🛷 <strong>TWO DAYS UNTIL LIFTOFF</strong><br>
            🌍 <strong>ONE NIGHT TO TRACK SANTA</strong><br>
            🎄 <strong>ALL THE MAGIC</strong>
        </p>

        <p>AAAAAAAAA WE ARE BASICALLY THERE 😭🎄💥  
        This is <strong>Fizzlepuff Starwhirl</strong> reporting live from a North Pole that has officially lost all concept of calm, sleep, and inside voices ❄️🧝‍♂️📣</p>

        <p><strong>🛷 COUNTDOWN STATUS: CRITICALLY FESTIVE 🛷</strong></p>

        <p>🚀 <strong>THREE DAYS</strong> until <strong>SANTA TAKES OFF</strong> 🎅💨🌍<br>
        😱 THREE. DAYS. That’s it. That’s the tweet. That’s the whole situation.</p>

        <p>And YES — the <strong>second-last test flight</strong> was conducted today… at an absolutely unhinged hour.</p>

        <p><strong>🌙 The 2:00 AM Test Flight Report 🌙</strong></p>

        <p>The elves were jolted awake by emergency jingle alarms 🔔😵‍💫  
        One elf arrived wearing mismatched boots.  
        Another brought hot cocoa and refused to put it down.  
        Nobody was emotionally prepared — but everyone showed up.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🛷✨ <strong>The sleigh launched smoothly</strong>, runners glowing and magic levels perfectly balanced</li>
            <li>🦌🎯 <strong>The reindeer formation held strong</strong> — only a tiny wobble when Cupid sneezed mid-air (rude, but forgiven)</li>
            <li>🔴☀️ <strong>Rudolph’s nose passed brightness tests</strong> and briefly illuminated half the Arctic sky</li>
            <li>🎅📋 <strong>Santa completed a full mock route</strong>, testing speed, altitude, and emergency cookie access 🍪✔️</li>
            <li>🛬👏 <strong>Landing was clean and controlled</strong>, followed by loud elf applause and immediate return to bed</li>
        </ul>

        <p><strong>Official verdict from the flight team:</strong><br>
        ✅ Sleigh: READY<br>
        ✅ Reindeer: READY<br>
        ✅ Santa: READY<br>
        ☕ Elves: Tired, but spiritually thriving</p>

        <p><strong>🎄✨ HOW TO GET THE MOST OUT OF TRACKING NIGHT ✨🎄</strong></p>

        <ul>
            <li>⏰ <strong>Show up early</strong> — the buildup is part of the magic, not just the launch</li>
            <li>📱 <strong>Keep the tracker open</strong> — things move FAST on Christmas Eve</li>
            <li>👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 <strong>Make it a group moment</strong> — snacks, cocoa, blankets, maximum coziness 🍪☕🛋️</li>
            <li>🗺️ <strong>Follow the whole journey</strong>, not just your location — every stop is part of the story</li>
            <li>😴 <strong>Know when it’s bedtime</strong> — Santa is very aware of sleep schedules 👀🎅</li>
            <li>🧘 <strong>Relax and enjoy</strong> — this year is simple, smooth, and all about the magic</li>
        </ul>

        <p>💬 <strong>REMINDER:</strong> Pre-tracking begins <strong>1.5 HOURS BEFORE LIFTOFF</strong> with live prep updates straight from the North Pole ⏳✨</p>

            <p>Hello festive friends! This is <strong>Cracklepop Jinglewink</strong>, your slightly panicked-but-still-enthusiastic North Pole correspondent, reporting live from a workshop currently buried in tinsel, cocoa mugs, and mysterious sparkly dust. 🧝‍♂️✨</p>
            
            <p>We’ve officially hit <strong>ELEVEN DAYS</strong> until Santa’s big launch! That’s right… the countdown is barreling toward zero faster than Blitzen on espresso. Here’s what’s been happening around the North Pole while everyone’s buzzing with excitement:</p>
            
            <ul>
                <li>🦌 <strong>Rudolph has been leading obstacle-course training</strong> for the younger reindeer — apparently dodging candy canes and snowball ambushes counts as “flight prep.”</li>
                <li>🍪 <strong>The cookie factories are in total overdrive.</strong> There are more chocolate chips than snowflakes out there. One elf tried to make a triple-decker peppermint swirl tower… it collapsed. Dramatically.</li>
                <li>🎶 <strong>The North Pole Choir is now rehearsing in three languages at once,</strong> including something suspiciously close to “Elfish Klingon.”</li>
                <li>🎁 <strong>Santa’s workshop conveyor belts briefly went haywire,</strong> sending toys flying into the snowbanks, including one rogue stuffed polar bear that’s currently being chased by a very confused penguin patrol.</li>
            </ul>
            
            <p>But while all this chaos is fun, there’s one story that’s… well… BIG. And slightly catastrophic.</p>
    
            <h2>❗ The Great Post Office Collapse</h2>
    
            <p>The North Pole Post Office — yes, the magical hub where humans could send letters to Santa and get replies in just a minute or two — <strong>has shut down indefinitely.</strong></p>
    
            <p>What happened? Brace yourselves:</p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>Apparently a gang of very mischievous pixie gnomes snuck in overnight.</li>
                <li>They “borrowed” the Post Office’s enchanted sorting hat to play hide-and-seek.</li>
                <li>Somewhere between “quick magical reply” and “ultimate chaos,” the sorting hat went rogue, declared itself <em>King of Letters</em>, and scattered all incoming letters into a wormhole leading to… nobody knows where.</li>
                <li>The Post Office is now officially closed while the elves try to locate the lost mail — which may take… forever. 😬</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>BUT FEAR NOT, HUMANS.</p>
    
            <p><strong>Tinsel</strong>, one of Santa’s cheeky and VERY resourceful helper elves, has stepped in to save the day! 🎉</p>
    
            <p>Now you can chat with Tinsel <strong>directly</strong>, as much as you like: <a href="https://speechless-parrot.github.io/santas-journey-tracking/interactive/elf-chat" target="_blank">👉 Talk to Tinsel here!</a></p>
    
            <ul>
                <li>You can send him images — he can actually see them!</li>
                <li>You can ask him to forward letters, messages, and wishes to Santa.</li>
                <li>Tinsel will respond with his usual mix of snark, holiday cheer, and absolute chaos.</li>
            </ul>
    
            <p>So don’t panic about the Post Office — just grab your cocoa, hop online, and start chatting with Tinsel. He’s basically the new official North Pole Post Office (but cuter, sassier, and slightly more unpredictable).</p>
    
            <p>Stay tuned for more updates as we barrel toward <strong>Christmas Eve</strong> — trust me, between rogue bears, gnome invasions, and Tinsel’s antics, you <em>do not want to miss a single day</em>.</p>

              </div>

            <div class="news-content">
              <p><strong>Bumblefluff Snowwhistle</strong>, your slightly-overwhelmed-but-still-smiling North Pole field reporter, here with today’s jingly yet deeply chaotic update. 🎄📰✨</p>
          
              <p>We’ve officially hit a massive milestone:</p>
              <p><strong>🎉 15 DAYS UNTIL SANTA’S BIG TAKEOFF! 🎉</strong></p>
          
              <p>But uh… about that sleigh… we’ve got some not-so-great news. Actually, it’s kinda VERY not-great. 😬🎁💥</p>
          
              <h3>❗ The Great Gift Explosion of December 9</h3>
              <p>To celebrate the 15-day mark, Santa and the reindeer took a test flight this morning — a little warm-up, a quick flyover. The elves, seeing Rudolph prepping the sleigh, assumed it was <em>already</em> Christmas Eve and frantically loaded <strong>every remaining gift</strong> onto the sleigh. Nobody told Santa. Santa didn’t notice. Off they went.</p>
          
              <p>Halfway through the flight, the sleigh hit a patch of magical turbulence — a sparkly purple swirl, possibly enchanted (or the work of a rogue snow wizard). The result?</p>
              <p><strong>🎁 GIFTS. EVERYWHERE.</strong> Tumbling out of the sky like festive confetti and scattering across the North Pole — rooftops, snowbanks, the reindeer snack barn, and yes, even one elf’s cereal bowl.</p>
          
              <h3>🎮 But You Can Help Save Christmas!</h3>
              <p>To help recover the runaway presents, the elves launched a brand-new emergency game:</p>
              <p><a href="https://speechless-parrot.github.io/santas-journey-tracking/games/gift-catch" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">👉 Santa’s Gift Catch</a></p>
              <p>Your mission:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Catch the falling gifts 🎁</li>
                <li>Dodge the snowflakes ❄️</li>
                <li>Score high to help the North Pole recover as many presents as possible</li>
              </ul>
              <p>Santa, the elves, and Rudolph (who’s feeling very guilty) are counting on you.</p>
          
              <h3>☃️ Extra Chaos From Today’s Investigation</h3>
              <ul>
                <li>One gift crashed through the roof of the Hot Cocoa Lab — marshmallow loss estimated at 30%.</li>
                <li>A present labeled “DO NOT SHAKE” landed in a snowbank and started vibrating. Elves are avoiding it.</li>
                <li>Donner claims the turbulence cloud smelled like cinnamon; Blitzen says burnt socks. The argument is ongoing.</li>
                <li>Santa reports he “didn’t feel the sleigh getting lighter,” which raises some concern about Santa’s spatial awareness.</li>
                <li>Elves patrolling the sky with butterfly nets: results extremely unsuccessful.</li>
                <li>The North Pole Weather Team has issued a <strong>Falling Gift Advisory</strong> until further notice.</li>
              </ul>
          
              <p>So yeah — fifteen days left, and we’re already losing half the toys to the sky. Totally normal December, right?</p>
          
              <p>More updates soon — assuming I don’t get bonked by a rogue teddy bear from 300 feet.</p>

      <h2 class="news-title">🌟 North Pole News Flash: A Blast From 2017 Has Arrived! 🌟</h2>
      <div class="news-date">December 7, 2025</div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <div class="news-content">
    <p><strong>Twinkletap Giggleberry</strong>, your overcaffeinated digital elf correspondent, bursting in with extremely sparkly news straight out of the Coding Workshop! 🎄💻✨</p>

    <p>After weeks of digging through ancient elf servers, blowing dust off magical USB sticks, and arguing over whether “retro” is an aesthetic or a threat, our tech elves have officially launched something <strong>VERY</strong> special:</p>

    <p><strong>🎉 GST 2017 — a full revival of the classic 2017 Google Santa Tracker experience!</strong> 🎉</p>

    <p>Yep. The Big One. The Legendary One. The version everyone remembers, loves, and still cries over during late-night nostalgia spirals. And now? IT’S BACK. <strong>LIVE. PLAYABLE. FESTIVE. CHAOTIC. BEAUTIFUL.</strong></p>

    <p>You can explore it right now at:<br>
    <a href="https://speechless-parrot.github.io/gst-2017" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://speechless-parrot.github.io/gst-2017</a></p>

    <p>Here’s what you’ll find inside this North Pole time machine:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>🎮 <strong>All the iconic games & activities</strong> — including the long-lost <em>Code a Snowflake</em> game!</li>
      <li>🧭 That cozy, nostalgic <strong>2017 map design</strong></li>
      <li>🎅 A <strong>countdown to Santa’s journey</strong>, just like the old days</li>
      <li>🧝‍♂️ A room full of tech elves cheering because they actually got this ancient code to behave for once</li>
    </ul>

    <p>And just like always — this whole project is a <strong>fun community-made revival</strong>, not affiliated with Google. Just elves + nostalgia + chaos.</p>

    <h3>✨ Extra Notes from the Elves! ✨</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>This project is <strong>not affiliated with Google</strong> — just a fans-made revival.</li>
      <li>While the site includes a countdown, we <strong>can’t guarantee</strong> the original tracker will work on December 24th.</li>
      <li>Come back on December 24th and give it a try — if it doesn’t work, you can also check out our main tracker at:<br>
        <a href="https://speechless-parrot.github.io/santas-journey-tracking" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">speechless-parrot.github.io/santas-journey-tracking</a>
        or the modern official GST at:<br>
        <a href="https://santatracker.google.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">santatracker.google.com</a>
      </li>
      <li><strong>All games and activities DO work</strong>, including classics removed from newer versions.</li>
      <li>Some features might act weird — this is a 2017 codebase being revived in 2025.</li>
      <li>Bugs and glitches may appear — that’s part of the vintage charm.</li>
      <li>The games run best on desktop.</li>
      <li>More updates may appear throughout December as elves fix & polish things.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>More news soon… unless I get sucked into re-playing Snowball Storm for six hours straight.<br>

        <p><strong>Grumplestiltskin “Grumpy Elf” McSnark</strong> here again, crawling out of my snowbank of paperwork to remind you festive gremlins that YES — we’ve officially entered <strong>December</strong>, the final (and most chaotic) month of the year. ❄️🎉</p>

        <p>And guess what? <strong>TWENTY days</strong> stand between us and Santa’s annual launch at <strong>10:00 AM UTC on December 24th</strong>. Twenty tiny little days. I've seen candy canes that last longer. 🍬😑</p>

        <p>No new tracker changes this time — the tech elves are “stabilizing the system,” which I’m pretty sure is code for drinking cocoa and pretending to work — but the North Pole has been BUSY. Here’s what’s going on:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>🎶 The North Pole Choir is back, and they will <em>not</em> stop practicing “Jingle Bell Rock.” I hear it in my sleep.</li>
            <li>🦌 Blitzen has been bulking up for the big night. Seven bowls of Magical Oats in one morning. Seven.</li>
            <li>🍪 The Peppermint vs. Gingerbread feud in the Elf Kitchen has escalated. Burnt aprons everywhere.</li>
            <li>📦 Present Wrapping is in meltdown mode thanks to you last-minute humans ordering more gifts.</li>
            <li>✨ Santa is in “focus mode,” which mostly means drinking cocoa from a mug bigger than his head.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>The vibes are high, the bells are jingling, and the countdown is officially ON. Keep your cocoa warm and your Santa Tracker closer… because the next 20 days are where the real magic (and chaos) begins. 🎅✨</p>

                <p><strong>Grumplestiltskin “Grumpy Elf” McSnark</strong> here—ugh, fine. Apparently someone decided the world <strong>needs to know exactly how many days are left until Santa’s Big Journey</strong>. So here it is: <strong>95 days</strong>.</p>
              
                <p>And yes, the tracker has been updated to <strong>v1.0.1</strong>. Here’s what’s new:</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>❓ Added some new FAQs—so even you humans can stop asking dumb questions about Santa, elves, and reindeer.</li>
                  <li>🐛 Fixed tracker bugs—goodbye weird glitches. You’re welcome.</li>
                  <li>📍 New tracker feature: markers on the map for <strong>every stop</strong> Santa makes! Click one to see:</li>
                    <ul>
                      <li>A photo of that location (yes, even where Rudolph got tangled in the snow last year)</li>
                      <li>When Santa is expected to arrive or has already arrived</li>
                      <li>How many presents were delivered at that stop 🎁</li>
                    </ul>
                </ul>
              
                <p>And now, straight from the North Pole (don’t tell Santa I told you):</p>
                <ul>
                  <li>🍪 Elves are arguing over cookie recipes—double chocolate vs peppermint. I side-eye all of them.</li>
                  <li>🦌 Rudolph got tangled in tinsel again. Honestly, I’m entertained.</li>
                  <li>🛷 Santa was spotted testing a new hoverboard sleigh prototype. Magic? Madness? Who knows.</li>
                </ul>
              
                <p>So yeah, humans. <strong>95 days until Santa takes off.</strong> Be nice, finish your homework, and try not to annoy the elves. We’re already stressed enough. ❄️☕</p>
